A customer is ordering one or more framed photos. There is an array of photos with keyword descriptors sorted by descending datetime in the format ["<photo_id>:<photo keyword descriptors>",...]. Extract the quantity of black and white frames desired for each photo. Return the quantities in the following format: <photo_id 1>:<black quantities 1>,<white quantities 1>|<photo_id 2>=<black quantities 2>,<white quantities 2>|... If a customer no longer wants a photo, set the quantities to 0. Below is an example.
